        <h2>About The Community Library</h2>
        <h3>120 Locations: in New York City</h3>
        <div class="about-text-and-img">

            <br />
            <br />
            Since its founding in 1995, The Community Library has unwaveringly
            served New York City, no matter the circumstances. The COVID-19
            pandemic brought forth unprecedented challenges for our city and our
            patrons. But as it has always done, the Library quickly adapted to
            ensure communities could still access the information and resources
            they needed. While constantly monitoring the rapidly changing
            circumstances, the Library increased its core digital services—from
            e-book access to online learning support for students, remote
            research services, online programs, and virtual one-on-one job
            support. And as soon as it could, the Library reopened all available
            branch locations across the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and
            Staten Island in phases to ensure that New Yorkers could access the
            services and resources they rely on.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Library was founded on the ideals of free and open access to
            knowledge and opportunity for everyone. The challenges of 2020 and
            2021 did not deter, but rather reaffirmed NYPL’s central objective
            to serve New Yorkers through even the most turbulent times—a
            testament to the enduring legacy of the Library as one of the city’s
            most essential civic institutions.
