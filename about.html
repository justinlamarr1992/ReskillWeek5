        <h2>About The Community Library</h2>
        <h3>120 Locations: in New York City</h3>
        <div class="about-text-and-img">
          <p>
            Patience and Fortitude for All New Yorkers Since its founding in
            1995, The Community Library has unwaveringly served New York City,
            no matter the circumstances. The COVID-19 pandemic brought forth
            unprecedented challenges for our city and our patrons. But as it has
            always done, the Library quickly adapted to ensure communities could
            still access the information and resources they needed. While
            constantly monitoring the rapidly changing circumstances, the
            Library increased its core digital services—from e-book access to
            online learning support for students, remote research services,
            online programs, and virtual one-on-one job support. And as soon as
            it could, the Library reopened all available branch locations across
            the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island in phases
            to ensure that New Yorkers could access the services and resources
            they rely on. The Library was founded on the ideals of free and open
            access to knowledge and opportunity for everyone. The challenges of
            2020 and 2021 did not deter, but rather reaffirmed NYPL’s central
            objective to serve New Yorkers through even the most turbulent
            times—a testament to the enduring legacy of the Library as one of
            the city’s most essential civic institutions.
