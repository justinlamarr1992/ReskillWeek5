            Two high school sweethearts get a second chance at their perfect
            ending in this charming new romance by Kerry Winfrey, author of Very
            Sincerely Yours.Once upon a time, Sandy Macintosh thought she would
            have her happily ever after with her high school sweetheart, Hank
            Tillman. Sandy wanted to be an artist, Hank was the only boy in town
            who seemed destined for bigger things, and they both had dreams to
            escape town together. But when Sandy's plans fell through, she
            stayed in their small town in Ohio while Hank went off to Boston to
            follow his dreams to be a musician, with the promise to stay
            together. Only that plan fell through, too. Fifteen years later,
            Sandy runs a successful greenhouse while helping her parents with
            their bed and breakfast. Everything is perfect...until Hank rolls
            back into town, now a famous alt-country singer with a son in tow.
            She's happy with the life she's built by herself, but seeing Hank
            makes her think about what might have been. There aren't enough
            cliché love songs in the world to convince Sandy to give Hank
            another chance, but when the two of them get thrown together to help
            organize the town's annual street fair, she wonders if there could
            be a new beginning for them or if what they had is just a tired old
            song of the past.

              Okay. Picture this: you are about to bite into a cookie. A big,
              warm cookie. Kinda crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside,
              yummy and chocolate chip-y and presumably made with brown butter
              and flaky sea salt, as all the best cookies are. And then you take
              a big ol' chomp, and...oh no.
