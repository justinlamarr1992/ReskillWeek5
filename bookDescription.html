        <h6>Summary</h6>
        <p>
          Two high school sweethearts get a second chance at their perfect
          ending in this charming new romance by Kerry Winfrey, author of Very
          Sincerely Yours.Once upon a time, Sandy Macintosh thought she would
          have her happily ever after with her high school sweetheart, Hank
          Tillman. Sandy wanted to be an artist, Hank was the only boy in town
          who seemed destined for bigger things, and they both had dreams to
          escape town together. But when Sandy's plans fell through, she stayed
          in their small town in Ohio while Hank went off to Boston to follow
          his dreams to be a musician, with the promise to stay together. Only
          that plan fell through, too. Fifteen years later, Sandy runs a
          successful greenhouse while helping her parents with their bed and
          breakfast. Everything is perfect...until Hank rolls back into town,
          now a famous alt-country singer with a son in tow. She's happy with
          the life she's built by herself, but seeing Hank makes her think about
          what might have been. There aren't enough cliché love songs in the
          world to convince Sandy to give Hank another chance, but when the two
          of them get thrown together to help organize the town's annual street
          fair, she wonders if there could be a new beginning for them or if
          what they had is just a tired old song of the past.

            This book hit me so hard. I finished this book a few days ago and I
            haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It has one of my
            favorite themes or tropes in a book, where we follow a main
            character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and

            Okay. Picture this: you are about to bite into a cookie. A big, warm
            cookie. Kinda crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, yummy and
            chocolate chip-y and presumably made with brown butter and flaky sea
            salt, as all the best cookies are. And then you take a big ol'
            chomp, and...oh no.
